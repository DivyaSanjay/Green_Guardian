   <strong>Green Guardian - An IoT Solution for Plant Care</strong>
  </br>
</h1>



## Motivation

Americans invest billions of dollars annually in houseplants, yet it is estimated that nearly half of these plants die due to improper care, especially from incorrect watering and exposure to light. This trend not only highlights the challenges of plant maintenance but also the economic losses associated with it. Our project aims to tackle this issue by developing a technologically advanced solution that can significantly enhance plant longevity and assist even novice plant owners in ensuring their plants thrive.

## Design Goals

1. **Self-Sufficiency**: The device should be capable of operating independently by harvesting energy from its environment.
2. **Accuracy**: Utilize precise sensors to monitor humidity, temperature, and light levels, ensuring optimal plant growth conditions.
3. **User-Friendly**: Provide intuitive notifications to the user on when adjust plant positioning for optimal light exposure, change from interior to exterior and vice-versa, and when to refill GreenGuardian.
4. **Minimal Interaction**: Design the device for low-maintenance care, featuring automatic watering, one-time detection for tailored plant care based on visual condition and species, and optimal placement advice for humidity, light, and temperature.

## Deliverables

- **Week 1-2**: Research and Development
  - Conduct thorough research on plant care needs.
  - Finalize the choice of sensors and energy-harvesting technology.
- **Week 3-4**: Prototype Development
  - Assemble the first prototype.
  - Begin initial testing in controlled environments.
- **Week 5-6**: Testing and Refinement
  - Conduct extensive testing to ensure accuracy and reliability.
  - Make necessary adjustments based on feedback and test results.
  - Prepare for demonstration and final presentation.

## System Blocks

1. **Sensors**: Humidity, temperature, and light sensors to monitor the environment.
2. **Energy Harvesting**: A module to convert ambient energy (e.g., solar or thermal) into usable electrical energy.
3. **Watering Mechanism**: An automated system to deliver water based on the plant's needs.
4. **Control System**: A microcontroller or similar device to process sensor inputs and manage the watering mechanism.
5. **User Interface**: Notifications and an app/dashboard for user interaction.

## Hardware/Software Requirements

- **Hardware**:
  - Sensors for humidity, temperature, and light
  - Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)
  - 3D Printed water valve
  - Energy harvesting module
- **Software**:
  - Firmware for microcontrollers
  - Mobile app or web dashboard for notifications, manual controls and one-time sensing instances

## Project Timeline

- **Week 1**: Project kickoff, initial research, and component ordering.
- **Week 2**: Start hardware assembly and basic software setup.
- **Week 3**: Complete the prototype assembly.
- **Week 4**: Begin functional testing and iterate based on initial results.
- **Week 5**: User interface development and integration testing.
- **Week 6**: Final testing, project documentation, and preparation for the demonstration.
